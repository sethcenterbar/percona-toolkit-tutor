# percona-toolkit-tutor
A quick wrapper around percona toolkit that makes it more discoverable with great examples, blog posts, and explainations.

I've kept the logic quite simple by extracting the content into a yaml file, so you can easily add benefit to the project by extending docs/tools.yaml


# Goals
My goals with this project are to demonstrate a working knowledge of the following
* python
* pip, pipenv
* setuptools
* yaml
* buidling cli tools
* click (framework)
