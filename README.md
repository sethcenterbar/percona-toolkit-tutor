# percona-toolkit-tutor
A quick wrapper around percona toolkit that makes it more discoverable with great examples, blog posts, and explainations.

I've kept the logic quite simple by extracting the content into a yaml file, so you can easily add benefit to the project by extending docs/tools.yaml

# Contribution
If you are familiar with the percona-toolkit, I would love for some pull requests to add your favorite examples, blog posts, vidoes, etc regarding the tools you use the most. Just follow the structure laid out in docs/tools.yaml!

# Goals
My goals with this project are to demonstrate a working knowledge of the following
* python
* pip, pipenv
* setuptools
* yaml
* buidling cli tools
* click (framework)

# ptt in action
